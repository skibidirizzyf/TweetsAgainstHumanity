**Tweets Against Humanity** lets you browse Twitter (officially known as X) as if it were a card game. You are given a set of tweets, and you only get to pick one to read, discarding the other ones.

This makes browsing Twitter both fun and mindful, as it makes you more aware of the content you'd like to see, and helps avoid mindless doomscrolling due to the eventual decision fatigue.

## Installing

You can install this as either an extension or a userscript.

### Extension

Get the extension from an extension store:
#### [Chrome (and similar)](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tweets-against-humanity/iffafbhcfbghbcbomboplepdbphdkjbi)
