# Tweets Against Humanity

Turn Twitter into a deck-building rougelike.

This extension lets you browse Twitter (officially known as X) as if it were a card game. You get given a set of tweets, and you only get to pick one to read, discarding the other ones.

This makes browsing Twitter both fun and mindful, as it makes you more aware of the content you'd like to see, and helps avoid mindless doomscrolling due to the eventual decision fatigue.
